Me: I want to allow users to input their city instead of hardcoding it.

AI: Use input() to prompt the user:

location = input("Enter your city: ")

Me: Can I make sure they don't leave it blank?

AI: Yes, loop until a non-empty string is entered:

while not location.strip():
    location = input("City name can‚Äôt be blank. Enter your city: ")

Me: Cool. Now how do I handle an invalid city name?

AI: Check the API response for an error message:

if "error" in data:
    print("‚ùå Invalid city name. Please try again.")
    exit()

Me: Can we show the local time too?

AI: Sure. Extract it like this:

local_time = data["location"]["localtime"]
print(f"üïí Local time in {location}: {local_time}")

Me: Thanks, this helps make it more interactive.
