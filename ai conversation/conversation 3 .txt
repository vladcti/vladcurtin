Me: How can I make this app retry if the API call fails?

AI: Wrap the request in a try/except block and use requests.exceptions.RequestException:

try:
    response = requests.get(f"{api_url}?key={key}&q={location}")
    data = response.json()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print("üåê Network error:", e)
    exit()

Me: Can we add a retry loop?

AI: Sure. Here's a simple retry loop with 3 attempts:

for i in range(3):
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"{api_url}?key={key}&q={location}")
        data = response.json()
        break
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        print(f"Attempt {i+1} failed. Retrying...")
else:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Could not connect after 3 attempts.")
    exit()

Me: Perfect. Now it‚Äôs more robust.
