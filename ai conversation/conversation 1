Me: I want to build a simple weather app in Python that tells me the temperature and condition in my city.

AI: You can use an API like weatherapi.com. Use the requests library to fetch data. Here's a starter snippet:

import requests
api_url = "https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json"
key = "your_api_key"
location = "Perth"
response = requests.get(f"{api_url}?key={key}&q={location}")
data = response.json()
print(data)

Me: This works, but how do I extract just the temperature and condition?

AI: Use this structure to access the keys in the response:

temp = data["current"]["temp_c"]
condition = data["current"]["condition"]["text"]

Me: What if the keys are missing? I want to avoid errors.

AI: Wrap the access in a try/except block:

try:
    temp = data["current"]["temp_c"]
    condition = data["current"]["condition"]["text"]
except KeyError:
    temp = None
    condition = "Unknown"

Me: Great. Can I make the output friendlier?

AI: Sure, use emojis and formatted strings:

if temp is not None:
    print(f"üå°Ô∏è Temperature in {location}: {temp}¬∞C")
else:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Temperature data not available.")
print(f"‚òÅÔ∏è Condition: {condition}")

Me: I want to log this data to a file. What‚Äôs the best way?

AI: Use Python‚Äôs with open block to write to a log:

with open("log.txt", "a") as log:
    log.write(f"{location}: {temp}C, {condition}\n")

Me: Thanks, this got me to a working 22-line weather app!
