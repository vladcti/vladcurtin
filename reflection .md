AI guided me in designing both the systems and layout of my WeatherWise weather app. I started by knowing how to retrieve weather data using an API, but structured prompts from AI (ChatGPT) allowed me to develop a full application anyone could use.

I started by telling AI I needed to connect with a weather API and it created a script using requests and weatherapi.com. It served a purpose, but the interaction was very raw since we didn’t handle errors, format the messages or use abstraction. After that, I prompted the AI to add error handling, only take needed data from the video (like temperature and its condition) and display the output using emojis. Making a few small changes in the prompt allowed the system to generate far better code which helped me understand the role of tiny changes in programming.

I proceeded to explore the wttr.in API and through prompts, I added validation, timeouts, clear outputs and even forecast data to my function. From asking the AI to explain every detail of the code, I picked up new methods including response parsing, controlling using APIs and writing secure codes.

The method that worked best for me was asking for specific things and carefully improving each time. 
In the end, AI wasn’t only a way to generate code, but it assisted me in understanding, fixing errors and working with more confidence. Today, I look at AI as an important resource in the process of developing software.
